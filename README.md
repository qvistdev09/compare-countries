This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## What's this?

This is a graphical interface I created for viewing information from the [REST Countries API](https://restcountries.eu/).

In this app you can:
* view information about a selection of countries
* get an overview of the area, population, capital, demonym and gini (a measure of inequality of wealth) of different countries
* switch between a spreadsheet view and graph view
* sort your selection on different values
